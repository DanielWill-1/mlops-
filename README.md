## 📌 Overview

This project tackles **shopping cart abandonment** using **machine learning** and **reinforcement learning**. It predicts the likelihood of a customer abandoning their cart and offers **dynamic, real-time interventions** like **discounts** or **recommendations** to increase the likelihood of a purchase.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Cart Abandonment Prediction** using `XGBoost` and `Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)`
- 🎯 **Dynamic Discounting** with `LinUCB` (Contextual Bandit) and `Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)`
- 🤖 **Personalized Recommendations** via a **hybrid system** using `SVD` and `BERT`-based sentence embeddings
- 📈 **Customer Behavior Analysis** and **purchase pattern insights** for retargeting strategies

---

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries**:
  - Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

- **Algorithms & Models**:
  - XGBoost – Cart abandonment classification
  - TFT – Time-series modeling of user behavior
  - LinUCB – Contextual bandit for adaptive discounts
  - PPO – Reinforcement learning for dynamic policy adjustment
  - SVD + BERT – Hybrid recommender for personalized suggestions

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Reduce cart abandonment rate  
- Increase successful order completion  
- Deliver **personalized, adaptive shopping experiences**  
- Improve customer **retention and satisfaction**
